#### Initial Findings
Rush hour ridership is increasing week over week (with the exception of weeks with snowstorm or Monday holiday) as seen below. Even with the snowstorm and holidays the trend is increasing.

I was able to identify  high and low traffic stations during the morning and evening rush hour time slots. The Top/Bottom 3 to 5 stations (just a matter of slicing that needs to be fixed) for the highest overall traffic by their rush hour window can be seen below (legend to be added)

I also have assigned the stations into deciles (per rush hour window) to allow for quickly identifying where staffing can be poached from (top 10% borrowing from bottom 10%)
